Demo - Pan Gesture Demo
===============================

This demo utilizes the MotionPanGestureRecognizer to move a box across your window.

**Getting it to Work**

Since the Leap dlls cannot be included with the project because of the SDK agreement with LeapMotion, please follow steps 2 and 3 under the "Set-Up" section of the main repo's README.

**What to Expect**

Upon successfully building and running, a window with a box should pop up for you. Using 1 finger, move your hand around to manipulate the position of the box in the window.
