Demo - Gallery
===============================

This demo utilizes many of the gesture recognizers in one project to give you a better idea of how to implement them in your own projects.

**Getting it to Work**

Since the Leap dlls cannot be included with the project because of the SDK agreement with LeapMotion, please follow steps 2 and 3 under the "Set-Up" section of the main repo's README.

**What to Expect**

This project prints out points and events to the console in Visual Studio for various Motion Gestures.
